You Matter Family Edition aims to support and empower families and professionals caring for children who use aided communication (Augmentative and Alternative Communication). This includes children who use communication aids and children who use symbol-based communication books or charts.

The two-day course explores:

* How aided communication develops
* How to select appropriate vocabulary for a child
* How to use effective strategies to support a child’s aided communication
* How to involve others
* How to set and measure communication goals for a child

Between days one and two, course tutors are encouraged to visit the families at home and video them using aided communication with their child.  These videos are then discussed with the group on day two.
An optional half day session is suggested that addresses any technical issues that parents and / or supporting professionals may find beneficial to help them move forwards.  For example, a half day session might be scheduled to address use of resource making software.

## Why the course matters:

* Empowers families-  You Matter gives parents the skills and the understanding to effectively take ownership of aspects of their child’s communication, to be an equal and informed partner in the care of their child and to be able to set realistic short term and long term goals for their child.
* Supports the important SEND reform principle of family and child-centred working (Children and Families Bill 2014), where the aspirations of the family and child are clearly heard and reflected in the long and short term goals within Education, Health and Care Plans. 
* You Matter helps parents and professionals to set realistic goals based on knowledge of their child’s aided communication stage, the specific strategies that are required to support their child and planning how this support can be delivered in partnership with professionals. Co-production is at the heart of planning and parents are able to contribute confidently with the knowledge and skills they gain from this course.
