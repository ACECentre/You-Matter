<p>You Matter is a set of two training courses that are designed to support and empower those around children who are using aided communication (Augmentative and Alternative Communication).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A brilliant course! Should be available to all parents, carers and teaching assistants involved with AAC”

<p>You Matter <a href="/parent-edition/">Parent Edition</a> is a two day (or eight session) course that brings together families and professionals on an equal footing in order to identify practical and positive ways forward to meet children’s aided communication needs.</p>

<p>You Matter <a href="/education-edition/">Education Edition</a> is a one day course that is designed to be delivered to education staff who work with children who use aided communication.</p>

<p>The You Matter courses are designed to be delivered by professionals that are experienced in the field.  The course packs contain everything needed to run a successful course, from the course Powerpoint which is full of video examples, detailed notes on delivery, to the handouts.</p>

<p>The courses were developed as a direct result of the authors’ concerns that there appeared to be insufficient aided communication support offered. Children using aided communication experience very specific needs, and those supporting them often appear isolated.</p>

<p>You Matter courses are not about the many forms of aided communication.  Instead, the courses focus purely on the underlying concept of communicating through aided communication, and on the importance of those surrounding the child.  The most important message conveyed is that You Matter.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-courses-were-developed">How the Courses Were Developed</h2>
<p>The You Matter courses have derived from the You Matter project which was carried out as part of the Becta Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Innovative Projects funding stream.</p>

<p>During the project, all those taking part were asked to provide extensive feedback to inform this structure of the course. In addition, opportunities for in-depth discussion were provided during workshops which followed the delivery of the courses. These workshops included managers of services as well several lead/highly specialist speech and language therapists.</p>
